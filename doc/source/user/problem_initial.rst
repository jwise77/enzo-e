*************************
Enzo-E initial conditions
*************************

*[ This page is under development ]*

Initial conditions define the initial setup of a problem.  They
include field values and particle values at the start of the
simulation.  They can be declared in the parameter file using Cello's
"value" initializer, or specific problem initializers can be invoked,
such as "implosion_2d" for the "Implosion test", or "sedov_array_3d" for
a 3D array of Sedov blast waves.

``"collapse"``
   Initialize a spherical collapse test.

``"file"``
   Initialize from input HDF5 file.  Not implemented yet.

``"grackle_test"``
   Initialize for a grackle 2.0 chemistry and cooling library test
   (depreciated).

``"implosion_2d"``
   Initialize an "implosion" test problem.
  
``"pm"``
   Initialize ``"dark"`` matter particles in either a regular uniform
   array with one particle per cell, or randomly following the ``"density"``
   field distribution.

``"ppml_test"``
   Initialize fields for the PPML solver for a high-pressure shpere in
   an anisotropic magnetic field.

``"sedov"``
   Calls either ``"sedov_array_2d"`` or ``"sedov_array_3d"``
   initializer depending on the problem rank.

``"sedov_array_2d"``

   Initialize a regular 2D array of Sedov blast problems.  Used for
   parallel-scaling studies without load balancing.

``"sedov_array_3d"``

   Initialize a regular 3D array of Sedov blast problems.  Used for
   parallel-scaling studies without load balancing.

``"sedov_random"`` [ Thomas Bolden ]

   Initialize a regular 3D array of Sedov blast problems.  Used for
   parallel-scaling studies with load balancing.

``"soup"``
   
   Similar to the ``"sedov"`` problem, but with letters instead of spheres.

``"trace"``

   Initialize ``"trace"`` tracer particles in either a regular uniform
   array with one particle per cell, or randomly following the
   ``"density"`` field distribution.

``"turbulence"``
   
   Initialize fields for driving turbulence, including ``"driving_[xyz]"``
   fields.

``"value"``

   Initialize fields using expressions directly from the parameter
   file.

   .. warning::

      For technical reasons, ``"value"`` does not work reliably for
      multi-node problems.
